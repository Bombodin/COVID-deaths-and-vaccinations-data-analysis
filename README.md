# COVID-deaths-and-vaccinations-data-analysis
Data analysis project of COVID deaths and vaccinations for my portfolio

## Overview
Goal of this project is to hone my data analysis skills through analysing the COVID deaths and vaccinations dataset to learn how effective the early vaccinations were in preventing new cases. I will be using some of the most popular tools for data analysis to clean, analyze and visualize the key takeaways form this dataset.
